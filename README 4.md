# Zimbabwe Maize Market Analysis for Food Security

This project analyzes maize price trends in Zimbabwe and forecasts future prices using time series modeling. It also compares price changes across provinces and calculates monthly price growth. The analysis is tailored for food security insights, aligning with the goals of organizations such as the World Food Programme (WFP).
